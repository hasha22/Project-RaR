    content: Alright, so there are three main things to look out for when on the
      job. First off is our finances; protecting the reef is going to cost money.
  - talkerName: Angela
    content: Then, we have the reefs' Water Purity and Biodiversity. We have to make
      sure both are kept at a healthy level or we risk losing the whole reef.
  - talkerName: Manager
    content: Okay, is there anything else?
  - talkerName: Anglea
    content: Of course, let's move on to your Decisions!
  - talkerName: Angela
    content: The Decisions are the main way we will be ensuring the preservation
      of the reef. You can only take a set amount each day, so choose carefully!
  - talkerName: Angela
    content: Each Reef has its own set of Decisions for you to make, and each Day
      you get to make new ones!
  - talkerName: Angela
    content: Lastly, you can view the Reefs you have to manage using the Compass,
      but we will get to that later.
  - talkerName: Manager
    content: Great, I'm looking forward to working with you!
  - talkerName: Angela
    content: I feel the same! Shall we begin the Day, Manager?
